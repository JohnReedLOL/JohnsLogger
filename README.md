# JohnsLogger
This is Johns personal logger. Optimized for rapid development, it makes debugging quick an easy. Verbose stack traces with controllable lengths help you pinpoint print statements and assertion failures. Choice of output level lets you filter less important messages and allows you to route all output to either standard out or standard error to avoid seeing out of order print statements in the terminal. Backs up all output to a log file stored in a "Log_Files" folder in the working directory. Easy to configure, easy to use. A simple, basic alternative to major loggers for quick and easy development.
